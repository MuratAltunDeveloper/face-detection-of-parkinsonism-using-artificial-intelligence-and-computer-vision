# face detection of parkinsonism using artificial intelligence and computer vision
 In this project, the evaluation of action units and combinations obtained from the face using Py-Feat with artificial intelligence, feature extraction from deep learning models trained with parkinsonism data and the selection of these features with the help of an agent and the processes based on downloading the features on a vector basis, etc. events are described.
